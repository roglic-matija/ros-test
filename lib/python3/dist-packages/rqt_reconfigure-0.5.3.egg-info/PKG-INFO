Description: This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI
            (reconfigure_gui), and provides the way to view and edit the parameters
            that are accessible via dynamic_reconfigure.<br/>
            <br/>
            (12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary parameters that are not associated
            with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure) might
            become handled.
            However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent
            on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params latched
            to nodes.
